## My process

I started this project with SASS and Webpack in mind. I setup my loaders and learned that there was a SASS loader as well. I started first designing the mobile design and gradually worked my way to the desktop breakpoint. I definitely have a few rules that overlap but I want to keep working the muscles so I'm moving on to the next project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack
- Node Package Manager

### What I learned

Regretfully, I discovered I am very slow. I learned that I remember less of what I used to know but I suppose thats a good thing, I'm taking a step back and focusing on good, clean UI design and responsive web development. The slow pacing of my project was partly bu choice and partly due to the way I set this project up. I wanted to get used to Webpack in my regular workflow and I wanted to use sass because I enjoy the nested ruling syntax.

I learned that I can use SASS loader for Webpack as well. I setup this project with Webpack Dev Server so that it would hot reload on save. It was very nice to have that in my workflow!

This was also my first project done completely in Neovim. I gotta say, I'm slow now, but I cant wait until I really understand vim motions.

### Continued development

Going forward, I will set out to be more efficient. To hone the setup phase of the project and to really move through each breakpoint, thinking through each rule to ensure I keep my code DRY.
